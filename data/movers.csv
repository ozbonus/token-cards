M1	1	3	Zoe is the youngest of the three girls in her family. Sometimes her two older sisters called her baby Zoe. I'm not a baby, Zoe said. I'm ten now! Last Sunday Zoe's family had a great day. They drove to the forest, went for a long walk and had a picnic. Then Zoe's dad read his book, her mother went to sleep and her sisters sat and talked. Zoe climbed to the top of a tall tree. From the top of the tree, Zoe could see lots of big, black clouds above the mountains. Oh no! she thought. Rain! She climbed down the tree and ran to tell her family. Quickly! Come on! Back to the car! When they all jumped up and started to put the glasses and bowls in the picnic bag, Zoe smiled I'm not a baby. I'm talking like a grown-up and they're all listening to me! she thought.
M1	1	4	Bats are small animals that can fly. There are many different kinds of bat and they live in many parts of the world. Some live in jungles, some live in trees or inside houses, but you don't often see them. Most bats sleep in the day and only fly at night. Bats can't see very well with their eyes, but they are all very good at flying. They can fly very quickly. Small bats sometimes eat mice, but bigger bats often eat fruit and drink juice that they find in flowers.
M1	1	5	Sally and her brother, Peter, live next to a lake and they love swimming and fishing in it. They often fish from the end of their garden, but last Saturday, they went fishing in another part of the lake. But there were no fish there. Sally, look! Peter said. I think I can see a lake monster! Sally jumped up to look, but when she did that, she dropped her shoes in the water! Then she got angry with Peter because there was no monster. Now I haven't got my shoes! she said. It's not funny! Peter looked down in the water. He could see Sally's orange shoes at the bottom of the lake. Well, let's try to catch your shoes now! Peter said. He fished them out of the lake. Sally was happy again. When they got home, their mum was in the kitchen. Did you catch any fish? she asked. She laughed when Peter said, Yes we caught two Orange Shoe Fish!
M1	2	2	Here are my holiday photos, Vicky! Wow, they're great! I like going on holiday. So do I. Where do you and your family go, Vicky? To the beach. What do you do on holiday? We do lots of different things. I love sailing most. What's your favourite hobby, Peter? I don't know. Well, do you like going to famous places? Sometimes! My dad likes fishing when we're on holiday. Mine likes sitting in the sun. Look at this photo!
M1	2	3	Doctor Brown had a nice new car and he loved driving it to the hospital every morning. Last Tuesday, the weather was terrible and when Doctor Brown drove down Top Road, he saw four people at the bus stop. They didn't look happy in the wind and the rain. One of them was Paul Parks. Doctor Brown knew Paul. He stopped his car and said, Don't wait for the bus this morning, Paul. I can take you to work. Thank you! Can you take Jim too? Paul asked. He works with me at the supermarket. And can you take my two friends, too? Jim asked. They work at the library. Doctor Brown laughed and said, Yes, OK! Get in the car all of you. Doctor Brown started the car again. This morning, I'm not a doctor. I'm a bus driver!
M1	2	4	Dolphins are like small whales and some of them have more than 100 teeth! Dolphins don't need to drink because there is lots of water in the fish that they eat. Dolphins sometimes play with people in the water and they swim in front of boats too. Dolphins live in the sea in families and the parents teach their babies to catch fish. They learn very quickly! Dolphins can't say words, but they can sing and talk. They're very clever!
M1	2	5	Julia's home was in the countryside. One day Julia and her black and grey dog, Cloudy, went for a long walk in the forest. They saw a white rabbit. It hopped behind some tall grass, and Cloudy quickly ran to try and catch it. Naughty dog! Come back here! shouted Julia. Cloudy came back but there was something white in his mouth. Oh no! Julia thought. But it wasn't the rabbit. It was a beautiful white scarf! Cloudy dropped it on the ground and Julia picked it up. This scarf looks new. I must try to find the person who lost it, she thought. Julia put the scarf round her neck and walked slowly back home. Cloudy! she called, Come on! Good dog! Julia opened the door and saw her Aunt Daisy and Mum in the hall. Hello Aunt Daisy! she said and took off her coat. Look, Mum. Cloudy found this scarf on our walk. Aunt Daisy looked very surprised. That's my scarf, she said. I bought it yesterday morning, then I lost it in the afternoon when I went for a walk. Julia gave her aunt the scarf. Thank you! Aunt Daisy said. And thank you too, Cloudy!
M1	3	2	My grandma bought me a car yesterday! Wow! It's a toy car like the one in my favourite film. I love cars. Me too. Have you got lots of cars? Yes, twenty. How often do you watch films? At weekends. What kind of films do you like? All films. I like going to the cinema, but I think watching DVDs at home is better. So do I. How about coming to my house on Saturday to watch a DVD? Good idea!
M1	3	3	Vicky and her younger sister, Daisy, were in their bedroom. Will you play a game with me? I want to be a doctor, asked Daisy. Daisy was surprised when Vicky said Yes. Most days, Vicky said No. Daisy got her toys out of the cupboard by her bed. She asked them, What's the matter? She looked into her crocodile's mouth. I think you have toothache, she said. Vicky said, He must go to bed. And Daisy put the crocodile in her bed. Then Daisy looked at her robot. You are too hot. You have a temperature, she said. Bed! said Vicky, and Daisy put the robot in the bed. This doll is thirsty, said Daisy. Drink more and go to bed, Vicky said. Daisy put the doll in her bed. Then Daisy said, Thank you for playing with me, Vicky. I think you are a good sister, but you aren't a very good doctor. You only told my toys to go to bed!
M1	3	4	Cows live in most countries of the world and give us most of the milk that we drink. Goats and sheep give us milk, too. Most cows live on farms. Farmers get meat and milk from them. Cows have 32 teeth, which help them to eat the grass in their fields. They eat grass all day and drink about a bath of water every day. Did you know cows can go upstairs, but they can't go downstairs?
M1	3	5	Paul lives with his family in Yellow Rock town. He and his sister Sally go to Yellow Rock School. On the last day of school, Paul's teacher said, Listen children, you have homework. First the children were sad because they had homework, but they were happier when they listened more. Your homework is to take a funny holiday photo. Paul went with his family on a beach holiday. They wanted to go to a beach in a sunny country because they lived in a cold, cloudy town. At their holiday house, Paul and Sally quickly put their bags in their rooms, and ran down to the beach. Then, Paul's mum brought a small picnic and a blanket in a beach bag with her to the beach. At the beach Paul's mum smiled. I love the sun, she said. Then big grey clouds hid the sun. It started to rain. Sally had an idea. She got the blanket and held it above her head. Her mum and dad sat under it too. Do you have your phone, Dad? asked Paul. Can I take a photo with it? Paul's dad gave him his phone and Paul took a photo of them under the blanket. Brilliant! That's my homework photo! he laughed. You look very funny!
